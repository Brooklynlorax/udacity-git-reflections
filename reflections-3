Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are splits off the main document that refer directly back to the master file.
Clones are complete, independent copies of repositories.
Branches are changes to a repository that have not been reconciled with the main branch of the document.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Collaboration could be managed with a server. Updated files could be pushed to the server with a unique name, like a tag -r1 (revision 1). New users could use the current revision to accept changes or go back a revision to remove changes.
